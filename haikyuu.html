                            Awesome storyline, excellent character development and mind-blowing animations, these are just a few things that have made HAIKYUU, one of the greatest anime ever created. For me, HAIKYUU is not just an anime, rather an emotion that one can't get over.
The story tells the Journey of Karasuno High School’s Volleyball Club, as they aim for the nationals. Under the leadership of their legendary coach Ikkei Ukai, and players like Tenma Udai, who was often referred to as “The Little Giant”, because of amazing volleyball skills despite small height, Karasuno were once considered one of the powerhouse schools in high school volleyball. But, since the departure of their revered coach, Karasuno lost their once legendary status, and are now referred to as fallen crows.
<br><br>
In comes Hinata Shoyo, one of the protagonists of the series. Despite his small height and lack of technique, his love for volleyball is immense. He got his inspiration from The Little Giant, and wants reach his level. Apart from Hianata, Kageyama Tobio is the other protagonist of the series. Often refered to as “The King of the Court” and “Genius Setter” because of high volleyball skills and IQ, Kageyama is initially arrogant and self centered. Despite their contrasting personalities and ideology, both Hinata and Kageyama share one dream,”Take Karasuno to The Nationals”, a dream which was long forgotten by the current roster of the volleyball team. And to lead them to this dream is the new coach, Kissin Ukai, grandson of the former coack Ikkei Ukai. Together with other students like their Captain, Sawamura Daichi, Ace, Azumane Asahi and Libero Nishinoya, Karasuno High School Volleyball look to qualify for the nationals and reclaim their status.

<br><br>Apart from the inspiring storyline, one thing that takes HAIKYUU to another level is the amazing soundtrack. These tracks capture the essence and emotions of the anime in such a way that the often lead viewers to get goosebumps. (I am listening to one, while typing this). 

<br><br>All in all it is a viewers delight, which lifts you from any mood, wether you had a hard day or you just wanna sit back and enjoy some good tv show without any complicated mess.
