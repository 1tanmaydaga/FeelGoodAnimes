                        According to me, the two elements that are bound to raise a person’s mood are LAUGHTER and GOOD FOOD. Now, imagine combining both these elements. Shokugeki-no Soma, or simply, Food Wars presents its audience with just the same. A rare anime, that deals with cookery genre, Food Wars is an anime that can be found on any otaku’s list.
<br><br>This anime takes place in a fictional world, where Tōtsuki Tea Ceremony and Cooking Academy is a famous culinary school located in Tokyo, Japan. This school has the reputation of the best and the harshest culinary school in the entire world. The students that this school produces are bound to be the best chefs in the future. Also, disagreement in any form is settled by a cooking completion between the parties involved. The dishes are judged by  impartial judges and anyone can challenge other to a food wars to declare his/her supremacy in the world of culinary.
<br><br>Yukihira Soma, is an extremely talented, yet easy going high school student who helps his father in their local diner. Unlike the others, his only aim in life is to beat his father in a food war, which he is yet to win, despite having almost 500 losses. His father tells him the only hope of Yukihira beating him, is if he attends Totsuki Academy and becomes the number one chef there. Unbestknown  to Yukihira, his father is a legendary chef, who himself is an alumni of Totsuki. He retired after his wife passed away, to take care of his son and their diner.
<br><br>The anime follows the journey of Yukihira as a Totsuki student, where he forms new friends and rivals and takes part in numerous food wars, with just one aim in mind – To surpass his father one day, so that he can inherit the family diner.
<br><br>One of the most unique thing about this anime is the amount of realism and factual correctness it brings while demonstrating the cooking techniques. Each ingredient, and the reason behind the technique is explained in depth and in a funny way so that it is informational and entertaining at the same time.
<br><br>My only regret with this anime is that the water it brings to my mouth while looking at the show. Myself, being a pure vegetarian can only just look at the scrumptious dishes that are prepared with different kinds of meat and seafood, because of heavy dependency of Japanese cuisine on non-veg ingredients.
<br><br>So, if ever in a mood to get a good laugh, this is your go-to show.
