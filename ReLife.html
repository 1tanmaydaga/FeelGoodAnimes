                            Rarely does it happen when a slice of life anime gives full justice to its Manga. Re:Life is one of those masterpieces that displayed the core of the story in a beautiful way with excellent animation and dialogues. 
<br><br>Imagine, if you could get 10 years younger. Your mind and memories would remain same but physically you are your younger self, allowing you to relive the experiences you might have missed at the age. Re:Life is based on the similar concept, where the subjext is turned into kis younger self allowing them to re life and change certain aspects of their life. 
<br><br>Our protagonist, Arata Kaizaki, is a 29 year old living in Tokyo. He is a NEET, Not in Education, Employment or Training, as he left the company he was initially woking for in just three months, and this instance prevents other companies from hiring him because they think he might not be dedicated enough for the job. Once, while coming home from his part time job as a convenience store connosiere, he meets Ry≈ç Yoake. Yaoke tells Kaizaki he is a representative from a company known as Re:Life, which allows the ths subject to turn in their younger self so that they may improve upon the aspects of hteir current life. Yaoke tells Kaizaki that the company has been observing him and offers him employment as a test subject for the Re:Life programme.
<br><br>Since, he has nothing lose, Kaizaki joins Re:Life. From then the anime tells the story of how Kaizaki tries to settle in a Japanese high school as a seventeen year old with the brain of a twenty nine year old. He reflects on his past years which help him to improve on his life. The viewers are also told obout the past horrors of his life which made him quit his job in just three months, and how he finally comes to term with it.
<br><br>All in all, a sweet, to the point  anime with slight comedy makes Re:Life a great watch. It has great very intriguing story line that keeps you hooked to the show and making you ask for more. It also excels in showing the darker realities of the society like unemployment, work-place harassment in a very light manner that thus not dampens the mood but gives a food for thought that the viewer can implore upon.
<br><br>A must watch in my opinion, which would keep you binging on.
